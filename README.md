# libintellibeans
Convert IntelliJ project to a Netbeans project.

This is a pet project of mine, more of a distraction from everything else I'm doing than a serious endeavor. I have almost no time for it, so don't expect much. On the other hand, feel free to fork it (it's LGPL, after all) to make it better for your own needs.
